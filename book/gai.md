# Using Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI)

Generative AI can be an excellent learning tool. It can explain an error in plain language, give a different explanation of a difficult idea, help you plan a test, and ask useful questions about your approach. Used this way, it can help you become a more confident Python programmer.

It is also a double-edged sword. If GAI writes the code and you only paste it into your file, a program that appears to work can give you a false sense of security. You may then be unable to adapt it, find an error, or explain your own submission. Programming is learned by thinking through the syntax, logic, and structure yourself.

## Use the University-sanctioned GAI platform

For University work, use **Microsoft Copilot**, the University's sanctioned GAI platform. Go to [office.com](https://www.office.com/) and sign in with your University credentials, then open Copilot. Using your University account gives you access through the platform approved for this purpose.

This recommendation is about **institutional approval and data governance**, not a claim that one tool always gives better answers than ChatGPT, Claude, or another GAI platform. Copilot is the safer default for University work because it is the platform the University has selected for use with its accounts and services. It uses your University sign-in rather than a personal account, and its use is covered by the University's approved route for access, support, and information handling.

Personal or public accounts on other GAI platforms can have different terms, privacy settings, storage arrangements, and data-use policies. They may not be approved for University work. Do not move University, assessment, personal, patient, or other confidential material into another GAI service simply because it is convenient or gives a persuasive answer.

University approval is not permission to upload sensitive information without thought. Use Copilot responsibly, follow the instructions for each assessment, and remove identifying or confidential details from prompts unless the teaching team has explicitly said that their use is permitted.

## A note about the videos

You may notice that I use ChatGPT at several points in the videos rather than the recommended Microsoft Copilot. Those videos were recorded before the University developed its policy and guidance on student GAI use.

Use Copilot for the same learning activities shown in the videos, such as asking for an explanation, discussing an error, or suggesting tests. The wording and screen layout may differ, but you can use Copilot in the same way to support your learning.

## A full disclosure about this book

I have used GAI extensively to help prepare and maintain this book. The underlying course materials, activities, examples, and teaching approach were developed independently over several years of teaching LIFE733. GAI has then been used as a production and editing aid: for example, to help reorganise explanations, draft alternatives, check consistency, and support technical book-building work.

Please treat this as “do as I say, not as I do”, but with an important distinction. This is a teaching resource produced by a member of staff, not an assessment submitted to demonstrate that I have learned Python. Your portfolio work must show your own understanding, judgement, and ability to explain and test the code you submit. The aim is not to avoid GAI completely. It is to use it openly, critically, and in a way that does not replace the learning you are expected to demonstrate.

All GAI-generated content in this book has been reviewed by a human before publication. See the [appendix on preparing this resource](appendix.md) for a detailed record of how VS Code and Codex were used.

## The rule: understand, then use

Before using GAI to help with a programming task, make a genuine attempt yourself. You should be able to explain:

- the Python syntax you used or plan to use
- the logic: what the program needs to do, step by step
- the structure: which variables, conditions, loops, functions, files, or data structures are needed and why

Use GAI as a tutor, reviewer, or debugging partner. Do not use it as a replacement for your own thinking or allow it to write a complete solution for you. Follow any task-specific instructions on permitted use of GAI, especially for assessed work.

## Helpful and unhelpful uses

| Use GAI to… | Do not use GAI to… |
| --- | --- |
| explain an error message after you have read it | produce a complete answer that you submit without understanding |
| explain a concept, such as a `for` loop or a dictionary, in another way | replace your own attempt at planning and writing code |
| suggest small test cases for code you have written | turn an assignment brief directly into a finished program |
| review a short piece of your code and ask questions about its logic | paste code you cannot explain, change, or test |
| help you understand why a test failed | hide or remove evidence of GAI use |

For example, this is a useful prompt after making an attempt:

> I am learning Python. My loop should count the number of `A` bases in this sequence, but it gives the wrong answer. Do not write a replacement solution. Explain what I should check and suggest two small test sequences.

This is not a useful learning prompt:

> Write my complete FASTA-analysis assignment for me.

## Check every suggestion

GAI can be confidently wrong. It may invent functions, misread a requirement, use code you have not learned, or produce an unnecessarily complicated solution. Treat every answer as a suggestion, not an authority.

Before using any suggestion:

1. Read it line by line and explain it in your own words.
2. Make sure it uses ideas you understand from the module, or ask for an explanation before using it.
3. Test it with small examples where you already know the correct answer.
4. Change it so that the final code is your own clear solution.
5. Record the interaction in your `GAI_documentation` folder when it relates to portfolio work.

Keep your code simple and readable. Extravagant, unnecessarily complex, or obfuscated code that appears to have been generated by GAI will be scrutinised. You may be asked to explain how it works, why you chose it, and how you tested it. If you cannot explain it, you cannot demonstrate that it is your work.

## Document your GAI use

For each portfolio task, save GAI records in that task's `GAI_documentation` folder. Documentation is not a transcript of every thought: it is a short, honest record that lets you show how GAI supported your learning without replacing it.

Create one Markdown or text file for each meaningful interaction, for example `2026-10-14_loop-debugging.md`. Include:

- the date and the GAI tool used
- the task and the problem you were trying to solve
- your own attempt before asking for help
- the prompt you gave GAI
- a brief summary of its response, rather than a large copied transcript
- what you used, changed, or rejected
- how you checked the result

Use this template:

```text
Date: 2026-10-14
Tool: [name and version of GAI tool]
Task: Task 1: count bases in a DNA sequence

My attempt before using GAI:
I used a for loop and a counter, but my counter did not change.

Prompt:
[paste the prompt you wrote]

Summary of the response:
The tool explained that my counter needed to be updated inside the loop.

What I did with this advice:
I moved my counter update into the loop and rewrote the line myself.

How I checked it:
I tested AAAT and expected 3. I also tested TTTT and expected 0.
```

If you used no GAI for a task, add a short file such as `no_gai_used.txt` saying so. Never include confidential, personal, patient, assessment, or other sensitive data in a GAI prompt unless the teaching team has explicitly told you that this is permitted.

## Ask for help when GAI is not enough

If you are stuck, bring your code, the exact error message, and the small test you tried to a practical or office hour. A demonstrator can help you understand the problem without taking away the learning opportunity.
